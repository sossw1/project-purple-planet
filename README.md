**Installation Requirements**

You will need [NodeJS][nodejs] installed for use with this project.

You will also need the latest version of [MySQL][mysql] or [MariaDB][mariadb] installed locally on your machine.

**Download**

[Download the zip][archive] or clone this project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/davidsaulrodriguez/project-purple-planet.git
cd project-purple-planet/
```

**Install**

Now install the required dependencies with npm.

```shell
npm install
```

## Configuration

To configure this application for use, you should create a `.env` file with your database information. For convience, a sample enviroment variable file can be found in the root directory with the name of: `.env.example`.

## Usage

Before using this application you should create the **Project Purple Planet** database. You can do this by running:

```shell
npm run createDB
```
> This command will create three databases. A production database: `purple_planet`, A development database: `purple_planet_dev`, and a test database: `purple_planet_test`.

After creating the database, you should build the site assets (JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc..) or else things wont work or look pretty.

```shell
npm run build:assets
```
> _**If you are developing on this project, you should rebuild the assets anytime you make changes to client side files in the project or else those changes won't take effect when you are running the server.**_

After building the project assets and creating the database, you can start **Project Purple Planet** by running:

```shell
npm run start
```

Cleaning up the built assets and starting fresh is as simple as running:

```shell
npm run clean:build
```
